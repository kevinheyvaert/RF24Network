#nRF24 Cluster Networking

We are students (Joris and Kevin) from the AP Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen in Belgium.

Our assigment was making a LEACH BASED clusternetwork with Arduino's and nRF24 modules.
We have based our project on a project of Maniacbug on Github.

###Progress

-made a BasicNetwork.ino: Made from meshping. Still work to do...
