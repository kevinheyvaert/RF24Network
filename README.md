#nRF24 Cluster Networking

We are students (Joris and Kevin) from the AP Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen in Belgium.

Our assigment was making a LEACH BASED clusternetwork with Arduino's and nRF24 modules.
We have based our project on a project of Maniacbug on Github.

###Progress
- made a StaticClusterNetwork.ino : combined helloworld_rx and helloworld_tx with static addressing

- made a BasicNetwork.ino: from meshping. This is a example with a Ir sensor send from node 05 to 02 over 00. Address 02 is hard coded.
